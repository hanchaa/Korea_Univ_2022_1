To aggregate data in Pandas, we use the `.groupby()` [function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html). The code below will group the `movies` dataframe by `genre` and find the average revenue and rating for each genre. You can verify you had the same number of groups as what you answered in 7a.
